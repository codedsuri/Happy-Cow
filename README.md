# Happy-Cow
This is a case study provided in my MBA course- Data Visualization. 
I solved the problem statement using Tableau, dataset was provided by college faculty which is resricted to share publicly.
Problem Statement for this case study are:
Ques-01: Explore data and forecasting products by using visual analytics.
Ques-02: Explore the sales performance of three consumer groups (students, staff and tourists)
Ques-03: Both Marry and Prem, senior sales assistant belief that different groups of flavor sell better at different times of the year. Do the data backs it up? please propose your groupings and visualize them to generate insight into the ice cream sales. Regarding flavor groups, does grouping gives a better level of analyses than individual level.
Ques-04: What outliers can be identified from the daily sales of happy cow? Please define outliers and how to address them.
Ques-05: Give characteristics of Happy cow dataset? what re the purposes of time series analysis (i.e predictive vrs descriptive)?
